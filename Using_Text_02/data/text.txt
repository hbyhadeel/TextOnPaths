Anyone can paint. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. And just raise cain. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You can spend all day playing with mountains. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.
